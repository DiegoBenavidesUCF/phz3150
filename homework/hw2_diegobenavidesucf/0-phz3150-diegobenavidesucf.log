 Homework 2:

 1a. Python 3 was downloaded from python.org about a year ago, and Anaconda navigator was downloaded
 from a course from UDEMY about a year ago as well. URL: https://www.python.org/downloads/

 The anaconda navigator included jupyter notebook along other programs.
 The UDEMY course also included a zip file with numpy, pandas, scipy, and other packages.

 Took a screenshot of my Jupyter notebook home page and saved the pdf as:
 hw2_diegobenavidesucf_prob1a_screenshot1

 Took a screenshot of my version of python from Jupyter notebook saved the pdf as:
 hw2_diegobenavidesucf_prob1a_screenshot2

 1b. Downloaded github desktop version and synced it with the class during lecture
 on Jan 18 10:30:00 EST 2022
 Screenshot of the github saved as pdf titled:
 hw2_diegobenavidesucf_prob1b_screenshot

 2. Correct syntax with incorrect tokens: B00k5 R fun 2 re4d.
 Incorrect syntax with correct tokens: Books to read are fun.

 The feature of natural languages that prevents them from being programming languages is
 called ambiguity. Meaning that in natural languages people can determine proper meaning
 regardless of syntax or token correctness since context clues can be used to determine the
 meaning. Programming languages are unambiguous and rely on proper syntax and tokens in order to function
 which is a feature known as literalness.

 3. Completed the hello-world tutorial, which included how to create branches, complete commits,
 create pull request, merge branches, and delete merged branches.
 URL: https://guides.github.com/activities/helloworld/

 Added the survey into my github during class saved the screenshot of the changes displayed on
 the desktop version of github in order to see the changes done to the repository as a pdf titled:
 hw2_diegobenavidesucf_prob3_screenshot1

 Committed the changes made from adding the hw1_survey.txt to the classroom repository
 HW1 folder and pushed to origin.
 The screenshot showing the updated classroom repository HW1 folder is a pdf saved as:
 hw2_diegobenavidesucf_prob3_screenshot2

 4. I saved all of the pdf screenshots and this updated work log into:
 /home/diegobenavidesucf/phz3150/homework/hw2_diegobenavidesucf/ and saved it
 as a zip file.
