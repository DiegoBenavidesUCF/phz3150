 Homework 2:

 1a. Python 3 was downloaded from python.org about a year ago, and Anaconda navigator was downloaded
 from a course from UDEMY about a year ago as well. URL: https://www.python.org/downloads/

 The anaconda navigator included jupyter notebook along other programs.
 The UDEMY course also included a zip file with numpy, pandas, scipy, and other packages.

 Took a screenshot of my Jupyter notebook home page and saved the pdf as:
 hw2_diegobenavidesucf_prob1a_screenshot1

 Took a screenshot of my version of python from Jupyter notebook saved the pdf as:
 hw2_diegobenavidesucf_prob1a_screenshot2

 1b. Downloaded github desktop version and synced it with the class during lecture
 on Jan 18 10:30:00 EST 2022
 Screenshot of the github saved as pdf titled:
 hw2_diegobenavidesucf_prob1b_screenshot

 2. Correct syntax with incorrect tokens: B00k5 R fun 2 re4d.
 Incorrect syntax with correct tokens: Books to read are fun.

 The feature of natural languages that prevents them from being programming languages is
 called ambiguity. Meaning that in natural languages people can determine proper meaning
 regardless of syntax or token correctness since context clues can be used to determine the
 meaning. Programming languages are unambiguous and rely on proper syntax and tokens in order to function
 which is a feature known as literalness.

 3. Completed the hello-world tutorial, which included how to create branches, complete commits,
 create pull request, merge branches, and delete merged branches.
 URL: https://guides.github.com/activities/helloworld/

 Added the survey into my github during class saved the screenshot of the changes displayed on
 the desktop version of github in order to see the changes done to the repository as a pdf titled:
 hw2_diegobenavidesucf_prob3_screenshot1

 Committed the changes made from adding the hw1_survey.txt to the classroom repository
 HW1 folder and pushed to origin.
 The screenshot showing the updated classroom repository HW1 folder is a pdf saved as:
 hw2_diegobenavidesucf_prob3_screenshot2

 4. I saved all of the pdf screenshots and this updated work log into:
 /home/diegobenavidesucf/phz3150/homework/hw2_diegobenavidesucf/ and saved it
 as a zip file.

 *****Out Thursday Jan 20 00:17:00 EST 2022

While in class internet wasn't working for me so I have to go back and redo the
shell command pdf demo on my own. I was only able to follow along reading, not actually working
on the arch linux command prompt.

Homework 3:

1. Created a new folder for homework 3 saved as phz3150/handin/hw3_diegobenavidesucf.
I created the new folder by just clicking create new folder within my directory.

2a. I created a new github repository for my directory phz3150/.
This was done by going to the github desktop app, clicking create new repository and choosing my
phz3150/ directory as the files I would like to add. I then published that new repository from the github
desktop app. So now the repository is also in my web version of Github.

2b1. In order to add my log to my revision control through git I clicked add the add files tab
that is on the github page for the phz3150 repository and adding my log from my directory
desktop/phz3150/0-phz3150-diegobenavidesucf.log and then clicking commit in order to commit the
file into my new github repository. Right before committing I typed a commit message that said:
"Putting my log under revision control".

2b2. I dragged and dropped my whole phz3150/ directory folder into my github web browser version in order to
commit all of my files to the new repository I created in this homework. I now took a screenshot of the
commit message page. The screenshot is saved as a PNG titled: hw3_diegobenavidesucf_prob2b2_screenshot1.
I took one more screenshot from within the committed phz3150/ folder in order to prove that my log
is also in there, this was saved as a PNG titled: hw3_diegobenavidesucf_prob2b2_screenshot2.

I now moved these two screenshots into my hw3_diegobenavidesucf/ folder.

***** OUT Wednesday Jan 26 9:48:00 EST 2022

***** IN Wednesday Jan 26 18:58:00 EST 2022

2c. Created a new folder within my desktop/ called test_git/.

For some reason my github stopped syncing to my repository so I deleted and recreated it.

I have recreated the repository one again to check if it will sync.

Now it appears that I have correctly been able to sync the repository, and I did this by deleting and recreating
the repository from github desktop app, github online, and my directory before recreating it.

Now after deleting and recreating everything I created a folder called testgit/ and I was able to
add it to revision control by making it within my phz3150/ repository before publishing it.

It seems like creating a new folder won't appear to my changes in my github desktop app,
so for now I will add an empty .txt file titled empty_file_for_change to hopefully bypass this issue.

It appears to have worked, so now I can finally move on!

2d. I now dragged and dropped the hw1-survey.txt file from canvas and put it into my
new test_git/ folder.

I now took a screenshot of how my github desktop app looks with the changes made
and saved othe screenshot as hw3_diegobenavidesucf_prob2d_screenshot1.PNG .

Now I will remove the survey after committing it and screenshot how something got removed
from the test_git folder.

I now took a screenshot of how my github desktop app looks with the changes made
and saved othe screenshot as hw3_diegobenavidesucf_prob2d_screenshot2.PNG .

Every time I committed the changes to my github I first wrote a descriptive message as to what the change was for and
then clicked commit, and then clicked push to origin which committed my changes to my github online version of
the repository in order to back up my work.

I now took a screenshot of my committ history for the third screenshot of the assignment and saved
it as: hw3_diegobenavidesucf_prob2d_screenshot3 .

3. I opened up anaconda, jupyter notebook, and went to my desktop/phz3150/handin/hw3_diegobenavidesucf folder
to open up a new python 3 jupyter notebook titled hw3_diegobenavidesucf_test_notebook.

I then used a markdown cell in order to type a brief description of my notebook.

I then followed and typed all of the code statements required by the rest of question 3.

4. I updated my log, committed it on desktop github, then pushed it origin, and added a
copy of my log to my hw3_diegobenavidesucf folder.

I will now zip it, and turn in my assignment.

***** OUT Wednesday Jan 26 22:20:00 EST 2022

Homework 4:

Problem 1: I created a new folder on my computer for homework 4 within my handin folder saved as:
desktop/phz3150/handin/hw4_diegobenavidesucf

I now went to my /phz3150/hw4_diegobenavidesucf folder through jupyter and created a new
jupyter notebook by clicking new python 3 notebook inside of the folder and titled the notebook:
hw4_diegobenavidesucf as the assignment required.

I committed the new hw4_diegobenavidesucf folder and the hw4_diegobenavidesucf jupyter notebook
to my github web version from my github desktop app repository by pushing to main and creating a descriptive commit message.

I put my name, homework number, and date as comments at the top of my hw4_diegobenavidesucf jupyter notebook
and put "problem 2" as a markdown in the notebook as required by the assignment
by changing the cell to markdown and typing in the new cell.

Problem 2: For the first part of problem 2 I typed the problem as a markdown cell and typed the F = ma (newtons second law)
as directed by the problem. I also formatted my problem 2 work by following the example provided in the HW4 instructions.

For the second part of problem 2 I created a function to get acceleration from force and mass. I typed this in my hw4_diegobenavidesucf notebook as:

def force_to_acceleration( force , mass):
    """This function will take in a value for force and mass, and divide force by mass in order
    to calculate acceleration.
    INPUT: Force[N] , Mass[kg]
    OUTPUT: Acceleration[m/s^2]"""

    a = force / mass

    return a

  As you can tell, I made sure to have a good docstring.

  After running this cell a created variables for the different forces given by the assignment named F_1, F_2, F_3.
  Then I created a variable for the one mass given, named m.

  I then created separate print statements for each acceleration answer. Here are how the statements were written:

  print('Problem 2:')

print(f" Force is equal to {force_to_acceleration( 100 , 150)}")

print(f" Force is equal to {force_to_acceleration( 22 , 150)}")

print(f" Force is equal to {force_to_acceleration( 450 , 150)}")


I now saved the work that I have for now by clicking save in jupyter and committing my work to my github repository by
clicking push to origin and writing a descriptive commit message for what I have saved so far.

***** OUT Tuesday Feb 1 22:18:00 EST 2022

***** IN Wednesday Feb 2 09:15:00 EST 2022

Homework 4 Continued:

Problem 3: I started problem 3 by adding the problem 3 instructions as a markdown in the jupyter notebook and labeled it under
another markdown cell that says "PROBLEM 3:" as directed by the assignment earlier in problem 2.

For the first part of problem 3 I typed up the acceleration function inside of a .py file separate
from the main homework jupyter notebook. I also made sure to have a good docstring.I saved the separate file my_saved_functions.py and I saved it inside of
my hw4_diegobenavidesucf/ folder. The code for my function is:

def acceleration( u1 , u2 , t1 , t2 ):
    """This function will calculate acceleration from dividing its change in velocity[m/s] by the change in time[s]
    or in other words its getting acceleration by calculating the rate of change of velocity
    INPUT: Initial velocity, final velocity, inital time, final time.
    OUTPUT: Acceleration[m/s^2]"""

    a = (u2 - u1)/(t2 - t1)

    return a

I then imported the function to my hw4_diegobenavidesucf jupyter notebook by typing "from my_saved_functions import acceleration" inside
of a cell.
Then to calculate all of the acceleration values using the given data I typed this code in order to satisfy the assignment:

print('Problem 3')

ui_1 = 10
uf_1 = 13
ti_1 = 0
tf_1 = 2

ui_2 = 15
uf_2 = 30
ti_2 = 10
tf_2 = 14

ui_3 = 32
uf_3 = 36
ti_3 = 14
tf_3 = 16

ui_4 = 42
uf_4 = 20
ti_4 = 28
tf_4 = 32

ui_5 = 20
uf_5 = 22
ti_5 = 0
tf_5 = 10

print(f'The accelerarion is { acceleration( ui_1 , uf_1 , ti_1 , tf_1 ) }')
print(f'The accelerarion is { acceleration( ui_2 , uf_2 , ti_2 , tf_2 ) }')
print(f'The accelerarion is { acceleration( ui_3 , uf_3 , ti_3 , tf_3 ) }')
print(f'The accelerarion is { acceleration( ui_4 , uf_4 , ti_4 , tf_4 ) }')
print(f'The accelerarion is { acceleration( ui_5 , uf_5 , ti_5 , tf_5 ) }')


I then answered the rest of problem 3 as a comment inside of jupyter by putting # before typing as directed by the assignment.

***** OUT Wednesday Feb 2 10:02:00 EST 2022
***** IN wednesday Feb 2 14:00:00 EST 2022

homework 4 continued:
Problem 4:

I started problem 4 by writing the two lists that were required by the assignment using the list and range functions.

I then printed them as instructed by the HW4 assignment.

I forgot to mention that I copy and pasted the problem 4 as markdown cell before typing my answers in a code cell.

I then used the proper slicing and indexing conventions to slice and print the velocity list from the 3rd cell up to and including the 5th element,
and then the 8th element.

In a new cell I called the acceleration function and printed all of the assigned cases for acceleration using the proper indexing to
get the proper answer for each case.

***** OUT Feb 2 14:54:00 EST 2022

***** IN Feb 2 20:08:00 EST 2022

homework 4 continued:
Problem 4:

After printing all of the acceleration cases required by the assignment I double checked the answers with
a calculator and mentioned that fact as a comment within my code. My code for printing all of the
acceleration values for this section of problem 4 is as follows:

#printing the acceleration for the required velocity pairs and corresponding times.

print('Problem 4:')

print(f'The acceleration is {acceleration( velocity[2] , velocity[3] , time[2] , time[3] )}')
print(f'The acceleration is {acceleration( velocity[3] , velocity[4] , time[3] , time[4] )}')
print(f'The acceleration is {acceleration( velocity[4] , velocity[7] , time[4] , time[7] )}')

For the last part of the assignment I change the value of the fifth element of the velocity list
by indexing the element and setting it equal to 90. After printing it is clear that the value of the
element was changed to 90, which is possible due to the mutability of lists in python.

My code for this last section is:

#Now I will change the value of the 5th element.

velocity[4] = 90

print('Problem 4:')

print(velocity)

After running this cell I mentioned the mutability of lists in python in a markdown cell.

Problem 5: I now saved the jupyter notebook by clicking the save button at the top left and it is already saved within my
/hw4_diegobenavidesucf/ folder.

After double checking that I saved all of my files I committed my hw4_diegobenavidesucf notebook and pushed it github by
clicking commit to main, typing a descriptive commit message, and clicking push to origin.

After pushing to origin I screenshot it and saved the screen shot as hw4_diegobenavidesucf_prob5_screenshot inside
of my hw4_diegobenavidesucf/ folder.

I then committed and pushed the addition of the screenshot to github following the same process.

I now saved the log, committed the changes to github by pushing to origin, dragged and dropped a copy of my log into
my hw4_diegobenavidesucf/ folder with the rest of my hw4 files.

I now zipped the hw4_diegobenavidesucf/ folder and it is ready to be submitted.

I now committed that change to github by pushing to origin.

Homework 5:
Problem 1:

 To commence homework 5 I created a folder for homework 5 titled hw5_diegobenavidesucf in my handing folder.
 I then opened up jupyter notebook and created a note book under the folder titled hw5_diegobenavidesucf under my
 /handin/hw5_diegobenavidesucf folder. I did this by clicking new and clicking python 3 notebook.

 Once I opened the jupyter notebook I typed my name, assignment, and date as comments as directed by the assignment.

Problem 2:

before starting problem two I typed 'problem 2:' as a markdown and copy and pasted the problem into a new cell
as a markdown as required by the conventions for assignments in this class.

I then began problem 2 by creating a function that solves for the roots of a quadratic equation when the coefficients are given as the input:

My code, docstring, and in-code comments also do a good job at describing my work:

def my_solve_for_roots( a , b , c ):
    """This function will calculate the roots of a quadratic equation, which are second order polynomials, given the three
    coefficients of the equation.
    INPUT: Coefficients of ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ( a , b , c )
    OUTPUT: a list of the roots"""

    # first I will calculate the discriminant to simplify the rest of the calculation of the calculation
    #Hopefully making it more readable.

    discriminant = (np.power( b , 2) - ( 4 * a * c ))

    #plugging in discriminant to the rest of the quadratic formula

    solution_set1 = (( -1 * b ) + np.sqrt(discriminant)) / ( 2 * a )

    solution_set2 = (( -1 * b ) - np.sqrt(discriminant)) / ( 2 * a )

    solution = [ solution_set1 , solution_set2]

    return solution

As you can tell the function properly returns a list of the roots as required by the assignment.

In the next cell I printed out the results for the set of coefficients given to me by the homework.

After printing the results I double checked my answers by doing the algebra by hand.


Problem 3:

Before starting problem two I typed 'problem 3:' as a markdown and copy and pasted the problem into a new cell
as a markdown as required by the conventions for assignments in this class.

To commence the problem I created the student_h list and populated the list with the correct heights given by the assignment.

I began to code my function and created a descriptive docstring but unfortunately after several hours of not being able to figure out
how separate the mathematical operations at the decimal of the height values I am stumped on this problem and I am deciding to move on.

***** OUT feb 8 20:12:00 EST 2022

***** IN feb 9 8:40:00 EST 2022

I will now copy and paste my prior HW5 log from my prior entry in order to have my work for this homework in one entry
since this was stated at the top of the homework assignment.

Homework 5:
Problem 1:

 To commence homework 5 I created a folder for homework 5 titled hw5_diegobenavidesucf in my handing folder.
 I then opened up jupyter notebook and created a note book under the folder titled hw5_diegobenavidesucf under my
 /handin/hw5_diegobenavidesucf folder. I did this by clicking new and clicking python 3 notebook.

 Once I opened the jupyter notebook I typed my name, assignment, and date as comments as directed by the assignment.

    discriminant = (np.power( b , 2) - ( 4 * a * c ))

    #plugging in discriminant to the rest of the quadratic formula

    solution_set1 = (( -1 * b ) + np.sqrt(discriminant)) / ( 2 * a )

    solution_set2 = (( -1 * b ) - np.sqrt(discriminant)) / ( 2 * a )

    solution = [ solution_set1 , solution_set2]

    return solution

As you can tell the function properly returns a list of the roots as required by the assignment.

In the next cell I printed out the results for the set of coefficients given to me by the homework.

After printing the results I double checked my answers by doing the algebra by hand.


Problem 3:

Before starting problem two I typed 'problem 3:' as a markdown and copy and pasted the problem into a new cell
as a markdown as required by the conventions for assignments in this class.

To commence the problem I created the student_h list and populated the list with the correct heights given by the assignment.

I began to code my function and created a descriptive docstring but unfortunately after several hours of not being able to figure out
how separate the mathematical operations at the decimal of the height values I am stumped on this problem and I am deciding to move on.

Problem 4:

Before starting problem two I typed 'problem 4:' as a markdown and copy and pasted the problem into a new cell
as a markdown as required by the conventions for assignments in this class.

I began this problem by creating the function displacement(u_init, t, a) in a separate .py  file since that was what the instructions
wanted.

my code and doctstring for this function are:

def displacement( u_init , t , a ):
    """This function calculates the total displacement of a body that during a time interval of t, a constant
    acceleration, and an initial velocity of zero.
    INPUT: Initial velocity of 0[m/s] , constan accelerations [m/s^2] , time intervals [s]
    OUTPUT: displacement [m]"""

    #formula for displacement of an object with constant acceleration

    s = ( u_init * t ) + ( 0.5 * a * ( t**2 ))

    return s

As you can see above my docstring is descriptive.

For the next part of the problem I imported the function into my jupyter notebook using: from my_saved_functions import displacement .

I then printed the answers for all of the requested pairs as follows (ny code for the outputs for the assignment problem 4):

#velocity

v_0 = 0

#time intervals

t_1= 2

t_2 = 4

t_3 = 14

#Constant accelerations

a_1 = 10

a_2 = 20

a_3 = 30



print('Problem 4:')

print(f'The displacement for an initial velocity of 0 m/s, time interval of 2s, and acceleration of 10 the displacement is {displacement( v_0 , t_1 , a_1 )} m \n')

print(f'The displacement for an initial velocity of 0 m/s, time interval of 4s, and acceleration of 20 the displacement is {displacement( v_0 , t_2 , a_2 )} m \n')

print(f'The displacement for an initial velocity of 0 m/s, time interval of 14s, and acceleration of 30 the displacement is {displacement( v_0 , t_3 , a_3 )} m \n')

I then double checked my math here with a calculator and all of my values were correct.


Problem 5:

I then committed my homework file to github by clicking commit and push to origin after writing a descriptive commit comment for this commit.
I took a screenshot of the commit and saved it as /handin/hw5_diegobenavidesucf/hw5_diegobenavidesucf_prob5_screenshot.png

I will now save this log, copy it into my hw5_diegobenavidesucf folder by drag and dropping, and then zip the hw5_diegobenavidesucf folder by Right
clicking and then clicking compress to zip file.

I will then push these new changes to github by creating a descriptive commit comment and clicking push origin.

Homework 6:

Problem 1:
I started by creating a folder titled hw6_diegobenavidesucf in order to comply with the course naming convention.
I saved the folder under phz3150/handin/hw6_diegobenavidesucf.

I then opened a new python 3 jupyter notebook inside of this folder by clicking new python 3 notebook inside of the phz3150/handin/hw6_diegobenavidesucf
directory through jupyter so that the notebook may be inside of this homework folder.

I then pushed this to github by clicking the all of the changes under the changes tab and creating a descriptive commit statement and clicking
push to origin inside of my github desktop app.

I then put my name, assignment, and date at the top cell of this notebook as comments:
# Diego Benavides

# Feb 16 2022

Problem 2:

I started by writing PROBLEM 2 as a markdown cell in order to identify that I am starting problem 2, as directed by the assignment.

I now imported numpy and pyplot as:
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

I now created the arrays that I was required to create by problem 2. My code is as follows:
# creating array

x = np.arange( 1 , 100.5 , 0.5)

y = np.log10(x)

z = np.sqrt(x)

I now created a plot from the mentioned arrays containing two lines and I manually made specific lines, ticks, labels, colors, and markers
as assigned by the assignment. I also saved the plot using plt.savefig() and made sure that my plot's titles and labels are legible.
My code for problem 2 is as follows:

# creating array

x = np.arange( 1 , 100.5 , 0.5)

y = np.log10(x)

z = np.sqrt(x)

#printing plot with all specifications from the assignment

print('Problem 2:\n')

plt.figure( figsize = ( 10 , 10 ) )

plt.plot  ( x , y , color = 'green' , linestyle = '--' , linewidth = 1, label = 'y(x)  = (log10(x))', marker = 'o'  )

plt.plot  ( x , z , color = 'blue' , linestyle = '--' , linewidth = 1 ,label = 'z(x) = (x)^1/2' , marker = 'x' )

plt.tick_params(axis='both',which='major',length=12, width=4,direction='in')

plt.xlabel( 'x - array', fontsize = 20 )

plt.ylabel( 'y(x) and z(x)' , fontsize = 20 )

plt.title( 'Plot for y-array and z-array as a function of x' , fontsize = 30 )

plt.legend()

plt.savefig('hw6_diegobenavidesucf_prob2_plot.pdf' , format = 'pdf' , dpi = 1200, bbox_inches = 'tight', pad_inches = 0.3 )


Problem 3:

I started by writing PROBLEM 3 as a markdown cell in order to identify that I am starting problem 3, as directed by the assignment.

I then created the array, q, that was required by the assignment, I then printed the array, printed where the elements in the array
greater than 50 using np.where() , and then I printed the value of the elements that were 50 < q < 70 using a boolean statement. This
can all be seen by my code as follows:

# creating array

q =  np.array( [45 , 24 , 5  , 30 , 3 , 67 , 33 , 60 , 65 , 13 , 82 , 75 , 21 , 77 , 67 , 8 , 86 , 62 , 23 , 70 , 11 , 70 , 21 , 15 , 84 , 51 , 6 , 79 , 78 , 66 , 2 , 93 , 49 , 74 , 23 , 85 , 25 , 38 , 1 , 89 ])

print('Problem 3:\n')

print(q)

print(np.where(q > 50))

print(q[(q > 50) & (q < 70)])

For the next part of problem 3 I started by making a list from q using the list() function.
I then printed out the slice of the list from element 12 up to and including the 14th by using indexing and slicing.

I then reassigned the 28th element from value 79 to 42 and printed the new value by indexing and it worked because list are mutable.

my code for that part of problem 3 is:

print('Problem 3:\n')

q_list  = list(q)

print(q_list[ 11 : 14 ])

q_list[27] = 42.0

print(q_list[27])


For the next part of problem 3 I created a tuple out of q by using the tuple( ) function.

I then printed the 20th element of the tuple by indexing.

I then attempted to reassing the 21st element value of the tuple to be 44 but it fails because tuples are immutable.

For the last part of problem three I was able to find which words had the letters e and which words had the letter a by
doing a nested for loop in order to iterate through the list and then iterate through the stings,
and in order to find the location index of the letters in each word I used the .find() function.

I printed the results for both of these things on the same line.

Then I made an if elif statement to check if there was the word star or bright within the word list.

My code for the last part of problem 3 is:

print('Problem 3:\n')

word_list = [ 'twinkle', 'twinkle', 'little', 'star']

#looking for words with 'e' in them

for word in word_list:
    for ch in word:
        if ch == 'e':
            print(f"The word {word} has an 'e' in it, the location of 'e' is {word.find('e')}")

#.find() helps find location of letter occurance in a string

print('\n')

#looking for words with 'a' in them

for word in word_list:
    for ch in word:
        if ch == 'a':
            print(f"The word {word} has an 'a' in it, the location of the 'a' is {word.find('a')}")

#checking if words are in the list
print('\n')

for word in word_list:
    if word == 'star':
        print('star is in wordlist')
    elif word == 'bright':
        print('bright is in wordlist')
    elif word != 'bright':
        print('bright is not in wordlist')
    elif word != 'star':
            print('star is not in wordlist')

Problem 4:

To commence PROBLEM 4 created a function word_to_number that takes in an english word that corresponds to a number from 0-20.
I made sure to include an informative docstring.

After making the function and the dictionary I printed the function for the numbers that I was required to call into the function
from the assignment.

My code for this problem is:

def word_to_number( english_word ):
    """This function will take an english word and return a corresponding number for that word from 0-20.
    this function uses a dictionary in order to do so.
    INPUT: english word for a number from 0-20
    OUTPUT: corresponding number to english word"""

    number_dict = {
        'zero' : 0 ,
        'one' : 1 ,
        'two' : 2 ,
        'three' : 3 ,
        'four' : 4 ,
        'five' : 5 ,
        'six' : 6 ,
        'seven' : 7 ,
        'eight' : 8 ,
        'nine' : 9 ,
        'ten' : 10 ,
        'eleven' : 11 ,
        'twelve' : 12 ,
        'thirteen' : 13 ,
        'fourteen' : 14 ,
        'fifteen' : 15 ,
        'sixteen' : 16 ,
        'seventeen' : 17 ,
        'eighteen' : 18 ,
        'nineteen' : 19 ,
        'twenty' : 20 ,
    }

    return number_dict[english_word]

print('Problem 4:\n')

print(f"Three is {word_to_number( 'three' )}")
print(f"Seven is {word_to_number( 'seven' )}")
print(f"Twelve is {word_to_number( 'twelve' )}")
print(f"Sixteen is {word_to_number( 'sixteen' )}")
print(f"Nineteen is {word_to_number( 'nineteen' )}")

Problem 5:

Before doing problem 5 I realized I did not copy and paste the entire questions as markdown cells before each problem so I did that for each PROBLEM
by clicking new cell and copy and pasting the problem into the new markdown cell.

I already put my jupyter notebook into the proper folder before even starting the homework problems so my
push to github screenshot will contain the entirety of the work I just did. Either way it still demonstrated that I pushed to github.

I then pushed this to github by clicking the all of the changes under the changes tab and creating a descriptive commit statement and clicking
push to origin inside of my github desktop app.

Now I will copy and paste this log into my hw6_diegobenavidesucf folder by dragging and dropping.

then I will zip the folder by clicking compress to zip file and submit my homework.

then I will push these final changes to github by clicking the all of the changes under the changes tab and creating a descriptive commit statement
and clicking push to origin inside of my github desktop app.

Homework 7:

Problem 1:

To commence homework seven I made a folder titled hw7_diegobenavidesucf within my handin folder by clicking
new folder in my computer.

I then created a python 3 Jupyter note book titled hw7_diegobenavidesucf within handin/hw7_diegobenavidesucf by clicking
new and then clicking python 3. After that I put my name, date, and assignment as comments in the first cell of the notebook
as directed by the assignment. I then imported numpy as np and matplotlib.pyplot as plt just in case I need it later.

Before starting problems I pushed these new changes to github by pressing commit, making a descriptive commit statement, and clicking push origin.

Problem 5:

I made a markdown cell to state problem 5 in order to follow the conventions of organization of the homework for this course.

I decided to start off with problem 5 because when I read through the homework It seemed like the most simple problem so I am getting it out
of the way first.

I found this problem to be very straight forward so I made a list with the pyramid outputs and used a for loop to print out
the individual levels of the pyramid one by one.

here is my code:

print('Problem 5:\n')

pyramid = [1 , 10 , 101 , 1010 , 10101 , 101010 , 10101 , 1010 , 101, 10 , 1]

for i in pyramid:
    print(i)

Problem 2:

I solved the first part of problem 2 by creating a string of the given sentence, then I created a list that separates the first string
by whitespace using .split() and then using a for loop that iterates through the list to print out the words individually.

I solved the second part of problem two by creating a loop that initially had my guess max length word equal to the first of the sentence and then
I made an if statement that would change the guess max length word to the new word if the new word iterated over was longer than the guess. I did This
by taking advantage of the len() function.

unfortunately I failed to make it with a while loop. so i left that failed code as comments so the rest of my code can still run.

then I made a print statement that printed the guess max length word which is now the actual max length word.

I solved the last part of problem 3 by creating a for loop that iterates through only lst_1[:6] which is only the first six words of the sentence
as required by the problem. I then printed out the set(i) in order to only print out the unique characters per word. But it is important
to note that the set() function prints the unique letters in a random order.

My code for all of problem 2 is :

print('Problem 2 part 1:\n')

# first part of problem 2:

str_1 = " Deleting an item from a list or array while iterating over it is a Python problem that is well known to any experienced software developer"

lst_1 = str_1.split()

for word in lst_1:
    print(word)

# second part of problem 2:

# with for loop

print('\n')
print('Problem 2 part 2:\n')

guess_max = lst_1[0]

for i in range( 1 , len(lst_1)):
    if (len(lst_1[i]) > len(guess_max)):
        guess_max = lst_1[i]
print(guess_max, '\n')

# with while loop

#guess_max2 = lst_1[0]

#while lst_1[i] != lst_1[i+1]:

    #if ( len(guess_max2) < len(lst_1[i]) ):

      #  guess_max2 = lst_1[i]

       # i = i + 1

   # print(guess_max2, '\n')

# Third part of problem 2:

print('Problem 2 part 3:\n')


for i in lst_1[:6]: # iterates through the first six words only

    print(set(i)) # prints out the unique characters but randomly because it turns the letters into a set.


Now I am going to save and push to origin all of my work so far for this homework using the github desktop app.

Problem 3:

I created a separate file for the function titled hw7_support_funct.py
saved in handin/hw7_diegobenavidesucf/hw7_support_funct.
which is where I will write my function for this problem.

The function I made properly solves the equation for why and loops through the x array in order to return a y array
which contains the solutions for y per every x value from the x array. In order to do this I had to initialize an array of
zeroes using np.zeros() for the y array, before using the function to populate it.

Now I will import the function and input the given inputs from the problem.

unfortunately I got stuck trying problem 3 because at first it looked easy enough but then I seriously struggled
and now I am getting a confusing run time error and its quite frustrating.

I am going to email the professor with screenshots in hopes of getting help.

Problem 4:

For now I am skipping the rest of problem 3 in order to complete problem 4, so that I can finish this homework early in order to start the midterm
in reasonable time. Plus I am just waiting for the professor to email me back on problem 3.

I made a mark down cell denoting I am starting problem 4.

To commence problem 4 I created a function titled order_array in my handin/hw7_diegobenavidesucf/hw7_support_funct .py file that takes in an array of numbers as input and returns the
array in numerical order.
I made sure to have a good docstring before writing the function.

I created my function by making a nested for loop that switches the position of the numbers in each element
if the next element is greater less than the prior so it should switch them until the array is sorted out
in numerical order.

Now I will import the function and check if it works.

I had a minor typo in the function so I just solved the issue by pressing space to make sure my return statement of the function
was in the proper indent level.

The function works and re-orders my array in numerical order.

My code for problem 4 is as follows:

from hw7_support_funct import order_array

print('Problem 4:\n')

test_array = np.array([ 4 , 5 , 2 , 10 , 42 , 22 , 8 , 12 ])

print(order_array(test_array))


My code for the function on the hw7_support_funct.py file is:

def order_array( input_array ):
    """This function will take an array of numbers and sort them by numerical order
    without using an built in functions on python such as .max() .min() or .sort().
    INPUT: Not ordered array of numbers
    OUTPUT: array of numbers that is in numerical order"""

    for i in range(len( input_array )):

        for j in range(i + 1, len( input_array )):

            if (input_array[i] > input_array[j]):

                input_array[i] , input_array[j] = input_array[j] , input_array[i]


    return input_array


    Now I have completed all of the problems except for 3 which I am still currently waiting for help for.

    I will now push origin to github from my github desktop app for all of the work I currently have.

homework 7:

    Since this is my final entry before submitting homework 7 I will copy and paste my entries
    for each problem here in order.

    I will also re-order my jupyter notebook, by using copy and paste,  since I started my problems out of order.
    I will also look through the rubric and update what I do for each problem if I missed something.

    Problem 1:

    To commence homework seven I made a folder titled hw7_diegobenavidesucf within my handin folder by clicking

        Unfortunately even after getting help on problem 3 I was unable to figure out the issue, I am looking forward to
        seeing the solution tomorrow in class.



    Problem 4:

        For now I am skipping the rest of problem 3 in order to complete problem 4, so that I can finish this homework early in order to start the midterm
        in reasonable time. Plus I am just waiting for the professor to email me back on problem 3.

        I made a mark down cell denoting I am starting problem 4.

Inside of this folder I downloaded all of the necessary files from the canvas folder for the midterm project
and moved them to my handin/midterm_diegobenavidesucf folder.

I then titled the given jupyter notebook midterm_diegobenavidesucf which is already in my

midterm:

Problem 2A:

To answer the first part of problem two I created a variable that is an input so the user can
type in the two locations of their journey: where it starts and where it ends. I also made a print statement to
ask them to type it in.

Problem 2B:

To answer the problem I just made a simple list containing the 14 bodies of the solar system given by the prompt.
It is a list of strings.

Problem 2C:

For the first part of problem 2C I made a nested if statement. The first if statement o check whether the start body is in the list, and the nested if
statement to check if the destination body is in the list, and if the bodies are in both I print a statement that says they are valid locations to
the user. The else statement is indented with the first if and if either body is invalid the else statement prints an error message, tells
the user what bodies are valid, and allows them to enter new bodies that are valid.

I then took screen shots for test case D-1 and D-2 and saved the PNGs to my folder /handin/midterm_diegobenavidesucf
titled as midterm_diegobenavidesucf_prob2_D-1_screenshot.png and midterm_diegobenavidesucf_prob2_D-2_screenshot.png

midterm:

Problem 3A:

For 3A I just used np.loadtxt() in order to read in the first data file with the solar system distances.

Problem 3B:

For problem 3 B it took me a little bit of reviewing and going through my demo notebooks,
because I first tried to use np.where() but I noticed that it made no sense for a string, in fact it
wasn't possible to use np.where() here. So after looking around I used .index() in order to get the indices of the
starting body and the destination body from the list I made in 2B, so that I what their index is in the data file
by indexing it in the data file using two dimensional indexing.

problem 3C:

For problem 3C I simply made a new variable for the distance of travel that is defined by indexing the data file
where I use the index location of the destination as the column index and the index location of the start as the row index.

I double checked that the resulting distance was correct by manually counting on the data file.

problem 3D:

For problem 3D I solved it by defining a time in year variable to be the division of the distance by the speed given, which is equal to a time
in hours so I divided by 24 and 365 in order to get the number in years. In order to remove the decimal remainder I used the int() function.

For the next part I subtracted my full time in years by the int() time in years in order to isolate the decimal remainder.
I then converted it to days from years.

I followed this same process to get the time in hours and minutes.

When it came to printing I simply printed the int() of each of these times so it was printed as desired by the assignment.

I was able to get the test case correct!

I will save my files and now push origin from github desktop app by clicking my changes, typing a descriptive commit message,
and clicking the push origin button.
