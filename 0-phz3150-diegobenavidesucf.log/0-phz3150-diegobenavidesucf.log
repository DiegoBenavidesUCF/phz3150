 Homework 2:

 1a. Python 3 was downloaded from python.org about a year ago, and Anaconda navigator was downloaded
 from a course from UDEMY about a year ago as well. URL: https://www.python.org/downloads/

 The anaconda navigator included jupyter notebook along other programs.
 The UDEMY course also included a zip file with numpy, pandas, scipy, and other packages.

 Took a screenshot of my Jupyter notebook home page and saved the pdf as:
 hw2_diegobenavidesucf_prob1a_screenshot1

 Took a screenshot of my version of python from Jupyter notebook saved the pdf as:
 hw2_diegobenavidesucf_prob1a_screenshot2

 1b. Downloaded github desktop version and synced it with the class during lecture
 on Jan 18 10:30:00 EST 2022
 Screenshot of the github saved as pdf titled:
 hw2_diegobenavidesucf_prob1b_screenshot

 2. Correct syntax with incorrect tokens: B00k5 R fun 2 re4d.
 Incorrect syntax with correct tokens: Books to read are fun.

 The feature of natural languages that prevents them from being programming languages is
 called ambiguity. Meaning that in natural languages people can determine proper meaning
 regardless of syntax or token correctness since context clues can be used to determine the
 meaning. Programming languages are unambiguous and rely on proper syntax and tokens in order to function
 which is a feature known as literalness.

 3. Completed the hello-world tutorial, which included how to create branches, complete commits,
 create pull request, merge branches, and delete merged branches.
 URL: https://guides.github.com/activities/helloworld/

 Added the survey into my github during class saved the screenshot of the changes displayed on
 the desktop version of github in order to see the changes done to the repository as a pdf titled:
 hw2_diegobenavidesucf_prob3_screenshot1

 Committed the changes made from adding the hw1_survey.txt to the classroom repository
 HW1 folder and pushed to origin.
 The screenshot showing the updated classroom repository HW1 folder is a pdf saved as:
 hw2_diegobenavidesucf_prob3_screenshot2

 4. I saved all of the pdf screenshots and this updated work log into:
 /home/diegobenavidesucf/phz3150/homework/hw2_diegobenavidesucf/ and saved it
 as a zip file.

While in class internet wasn't working for me so I have to go back and redo the
shell command pdf demo on my own. I was only able to follow along reading, not actually working
on the arch linux command prompt.

Homework 3:

1. Created a new folder for homework 3 saved as phz3150/handin/hw3_diegobenavidesucf.
I created the new folder by just clicking create new folder within my directory.

2a. I created a new github repository for my directory phz3150/.
This was done by going to the github desktop app, clicking create new repository and choosing my
phz3150/ directory as the files I would like to add. I then published that new repository from the github
desktop app. So now the repository is also in my web version of Github.

2b1. In order to add my log to my revision control through git I clicked add the add files tab
that is on the github page for the phz3150 repository and adding my log from my directory
desktop/phz3150/0-phz3150-diegobenavidesucf.log and then clicking commit in order to commit the
file into my new github repository. Right before committing I typed a commit message that said:
"Putting my log under revision control".

2b2. I dragged and dropped my whole phz3150/ directory folder into my github web browser version in order to
commit all of my files to the new repository I created in this homework. I now took a screenshot of the
commit message page. The screenshot is saved as a PNG titled: hw3_diegobenavidesucf_prob2b2_screenshot1.
I took one more screenshot from within the committed phz3150/ folder in order to prove that my log
is also in there, this was saved as a PNG titled: hw3_diegobenavidesucf_prob2b2_screenshot2.

I now moved these two screenshots into my hw3_diegobenavidesucf/ folder.

2c. Created a new folder within my desktop/ called test_git/.

For some reason my github stopped syncing to my repository so I deleted and recreated it.

I have recreated the repository one again to check if it will sync.

Now it appears that I have correctly been able to sync the repository, and I did this by deleting and recreating
the repository from github desktop app, github online, and my directory before recreating it.

Now after deleting and recreating everything I created a folder called testgit/ and I was able to
add it to revision control by making it within my phz3150/ repository before publishing it.

It seems like creating a new folder won't appear to my changes in my github desktop app,
so for now I will add an empty .txt file titled empty_file_for_change to hopefully bypass this issue.

It appears to have worked, so now I can finally move on!

2d. I now dragged and dropped the hw1-survey.txt file from canvas and put it into my
new test_git/ folder.

I now took a screenshot of how my github desktop app looks with the changes made
and saved othe screenshot as hw3_diegobenavidesucf_prob2d_screenshot1.PNG .

Now I will remove the survey after committing it and screenshot how something got removed
from the test_git folder.

I now took a screenshot of how my github desktop app looks with the changes made
and saved othe screenshot as hw3_diegobenavidesucf_prob2d_screenshot2.PNG .

Every time I committed the changes to my github I first wrote a descriptive message as to what the change was for and
then clicked commit, and then clicked push to origin which committed my changes to my github online version of
the repository in order to back up my work.

I now took a screenshot of my committ history for the third screenshot of the assignment and saved
it as: hw3_diegobenavidesucf_prob2d_screenshot3 .

3. I opened up anaconda, jupyter notebook, and went to my desktop/phz3150/handin/hw3_diegobenavidesucf folder
to open up a new python 3 jupyter notebook titled hw3_diegobenavidesucf_test_notebook.

I then used a markdown cell in order to type a brief description of my notebook.

I then followed and typed all of the code statements required by the rest of question 3.

4. I updated my log, committed it on desktop github, then pushed it origin, and added a
copy of my log to my hw3_diegobenavidesucf folder.

I will now zip it, and turn in my assignment.

Homework 4:

1. I created a new folder on my computer for homework 4 within my handin folder saved as:
desktop/phz3150/handin/hw4_diegobenavidesucf

I now went to my /phz3150/hw4_diegobenavidesucf folder through jupyter and created a new
jupyter notebook by clicking new python 3 notebook inside of the folder and titled the notebook:
hw4_diegobenavidesucf as the assignment required.

I committed the new hw4_diegobenavidesucf folder and the hw4_diegobenavidesucf jupyter notebook
to my github web version from my github desktop app repository by pushing to main and creating a descriptive commit message.

I put my name, homework number, and date as comments at the top of my hw4_diegobenavidesucf jupyter notebook
and put "problem 2" as a markdown in the notebook as required by the assignment
by changing the cell to markdown and typing in the new cell.

2. For the first part of problem 2 I typed the problem as a markdown cell and typed the F = ma (newtons second law)
as directed by the problem. I also formatted my problem 2 work by following the example provided in the HW4 instructions.

For the second part of problem 2 I created a function to get acceleration from force and mass. I typed this in my hw4_diegobenavidesucf notebook as:

def force_to_acceleration( force , mass):
    """This function will take in a value for force and mass, and divide force by mass in order
    to calculate acceleration.
    INPUT: Force[N] , Mass[kg]
    OUTPUT: Acceleration[m/s^2]"""

    a = force / mass

    return a

  As you can tell, I made sure to have a good docstring.

  After running this cell a created variables for the different forces given by the assignment named F_1, F_2, F_3.
  Then I created a variable for the one mass given, named m.

  I then created separate print statements for each acceleration answer. Here are how the statements were written:

  print('Problem 2:')

print(f" Force is equal to {force_to_acceleration( 100 , 150)}")

print(f" Force is equal to {force_to_acceleration( 22 , 150)}")

print(f" Force is equal to {force_to_acceleration( 450 , 150)}")


I now saved the work that I have for now by clicking save in jupyter and committing my work to my github repository by
clicking push to origin and writing a descriptive commit message for what I have saved so far.
